# Master Algo in Golang

This repository aims to bring out solutions to problems that are required in many areas, including interviewing practice. Instead of finding other famous repositories, I would like to take it step by step in creating my own collection from scratch (just to make sure I know the "wheel" clearly). As a matter of fact, the repo is updated every day with new things I learn from Golang professionals, not just for optimal solutions but also for clean code and an understanding of the Golang.

Therefore, the repo may not be good enough for guys looking for optimal solutions, especially for problems collected in leetcode. If you're the one looking for the optimized collection, please take a look at [LeetCode in Go](https://github.com/halfrost/LeetCode-Go).
